      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>Hi! I'm a rising junior studying CS at UC Berkeley, with an emphasis in data engineering. 
          I am particularly interested in the applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning 
          in engineering solutions to problems, but am always excited to explore new fields! I also love teaching CS 
          and am really passionate about making the subject accessible to all!</p>
      <p>In my free time, I love to 3D model cool designs using Autodesk Inventor and make amateur artwork out of 
          recycled wires, gears, and resistors. Last year, I took apart an old printer to make a small art installation 
          for my wall! I also enjoy hiking, biking (especially spin), and eating chocolate. :) Once, I finished a Trader 
          Joe's pound plus chocolate bar in four days. (It was during dead week, so no regrets!) </p>
      <p>Currently I'm working on developing a love for running long distances. I can't wait to get past the pain and 
          finally achieve the famous "runner's high"! On a more technical note, I'm expanding my software engineering 
          skills as a STEP Intern at Google for Summer 2020.</p>
